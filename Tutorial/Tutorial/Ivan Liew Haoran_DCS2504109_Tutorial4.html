A <i><b>shepherd</i></b> boy in a village need to take his herd of sheep across the fields
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.

<br>
<br>

One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,"Wolf!Wolf!The wolf is carrying
away a lamb!"Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but
didn't find any wolf.

<br>
<br>

The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <b><i><big>The boy
played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></big>

<br>
<br>

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf!Wolf!<strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</strike>"

<br>
<br>

<font face=Arial size=3 color purple>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</font>
<font face=Arial size=3>So, no one paid
attention to him and didn't come to his help.
